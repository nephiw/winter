# Winter Belle Creek

This is the source code for the winter marketting site for the Belle Creek Community. It has a house decoration signup form, voting, and a management page. It uses several 3rd party components and services, but the most important is @angular/fire.

This project was originlly built using the Angular 6 CLI - it gets neglected every year, but I have updated it to Angular 8 this year and hope to make it more sustainable for future development and use.
